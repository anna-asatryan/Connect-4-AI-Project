# Connect-4 AI Project

This repository contains an academic study on the AI strategies for solving the classic Connect-4 game. The focus of this project is the paper (final report), which evaluates and compares various algorithms and heuristics, supported by code implementations and experimental results.

## Abstract

Connect-4 is a two-player strategy game where various artificial intelligence techniques can be explored. The study evaluates multiple AI algorithms and heuristics to identify strategies for solving Connect-4. It explores the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Minimax algorithm variations, and heuristic approaches, such as feature-based and board-based methods. Through testing, the project assesses different agentsâ€™ computation time, memory usage, and win rates. Results highlight the first-player advantage, the effectiveness of Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, and the high computational cost of MCTS.
